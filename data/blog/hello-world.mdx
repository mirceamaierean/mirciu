# Hi there!

This is the first post of the blog on my website. I'm not sure what I'll write about, but I'll try to keep it interesting. I'll probably write about my projects, my thoughts on various topics, and maybe some tutorials. I'll try to keep it as diverse as possible.

For starting, I'll just attach to this post a code snippet of the famous "Hello World!" program. I'll write it in C++, because it's the language I'm most proeficient in.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    return 0;
}
```
